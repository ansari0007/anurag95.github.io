      <p>Information Retrieval and Extraction
Major Project  </p>

<p>First Deliverable ­ Scope 
Humour detection in Yelp reviews using Deep Learning </p>

<h3>
<a id="problem-statement" class="anchor" href="#problem-statement" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem Statement:</h3>

<p>Our problem is to predict community determined humor in Yelp reviews. Yelp reviews can be 
voted as funny and, given a review, it is our task to label it as funny or not, using machine 
learning techniques. </p>

<h3>
<a id="applications--" class="anchor" href="#applications--" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Applications  ­</h3>

<p>Yelp is a service whose utility relies on being able to provide an accurate, crowd­sourced 
opinion of a place of business. So it’s important to determine which reviews provide valuable 
insight into a business. Humor could play an important role in this determination and help 
consumers to get to informative reviews and not waste time on reviews which have nothing to 
provide. So, our project would help in correctly identifying humor. 
Challenges ­ 
We cannot have an idea whether or not our models can be extended out­of­domain. This is 
because there is no labeled corpus of funny texts – partially due to the subjectivity associated 
with imposing a binary outcome on something such as humor. Some work has been done 
applying similar methods to Twitter, but no large, labelled datasets exist for thorough validation. 
Second Deliverables Details ­<br>
Pre­processing ­<br>
1. Tokenize the reviews, without removing stop words or punctuations, as they are quite 
expressive in the context of Yelp.<br>
2. Build word vectors using gensim package. 
Shallow Algorithms ­<br>
Explore shallow algorithms before moving to Deep Learning. We will apply SVM on bag of 
words. Evaluation ­<br>
We convert the above mentioned problem into the binary classification regime. After balancing 
the classes according to funny and not­funny, we optimize the classical log­likelihood and report 
the classification accuracy. 
Third Deliverables Details ­<br>
Implement the following deep learning techniques ­<br>
1. Deep Feedforward Networks on two types of architectures – a classic, deep rectifier 
network with heavy dropout, and a slightly more modern, shallower MaxOut. 
2. Convolutional Neural Networks
