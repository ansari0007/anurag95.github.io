<a id="problem-statement" class="anchor" href="#problem-statement" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem Statement:</h3>

<p>Our problem is to predict community determined humor in Yelp reviews. Yelp reviews can be 
voted as funny and, given a review, it is our task to label it as funny or not, using machine 
learning techniques. </p>

<h3>
<a id="applications--" class="anchor" href="#applications--" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Applications  ­</h3>

<p>Yelp is a service whose utility relies on being able to provide an accurate, crowd sourced 
opinion of a place of business. So it’s important to determine which reviews provide valuable 
insight into a business. Humor could play an important role in this determination and help 
consumers to get to informative reviews and not waste time on reviews which have nothing to 
provide. So, our project would help in correctly identifying humor.</p>

<a id="challenges-" class="anchor" href="#challenges-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges ­</h3>

<p>We cannot have an idea whether or not our models can be extended out of ­domain. This is 
because there is no labeled corpus of funny texts – partially due to the subjectivity associated 
with imposing a binary outcome on something such as humor. Some work has been done 
applying similar methods to Twitter, but no large, labelled datasets exist for thorough validation. </p>

<a id="preprocessing-" class="anchor" href="#preprocessing-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pre­processing ­</h3>

<ol>
<li>Tokenize the reviews, without removing stop words or punctuations, as they are quite 
expressive in the context of Yelp.<br>
</li>
<li>Build word vectors using gensim package.</li>
</ol>

<p>Made feature vectors using Tf-Idf Vectorization and fed this to SVM classifier with linear kernel and got 85.0% accuracy.
The SVM train function from scikit library of python was used for this.</p>

<a id="deep-feedforward-neural-network" class="anchor" href="#deep-feedforward-neural-network" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deep Feedforward Neural Network</h3>

<p>Created word vectors of length 100 on the reviews using gensim Word2Vec and fed the 1D feature vector as input to the neural network with a hidden layer and 2 output units. After running for 30 epochs, with 20% test data, the accuracy was 89.87</p>

<a id="convolutional-neural-networks" class="anchor" href="#convolutional-neural-networks" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>

<p>The input was convoluted with filters of size 3,4,5,6 and width same as that of the input. We trained CNN for 20 epochs with a batch size of 100. Using 1-max pooling for each filter, we get a 1D vector. This vector is the input to the softmax layer which classifies the review as funny or not funny. The accuracy was </p>
